Virtual Constructor:

You can't have virtual constructors because when an object is being created, the compiler sets up a special pointer (virtual pointer) to point to a table of functions (vtable). This happens during construction. Since constructors are responsible for creating the object, they can't be virtual because, at that point, the object isn't fully ready, and there's no function pointer to point to in the virtual table.


Virtual Copy Constructor:

In C++, a copy constructor makes a new object by copying another. If you want the program to decide the object type at runtime based on user input or conditions, you need a special "virtual copy constructor." It has extra powers to dynamically create objects, allowing real-time cloning based on changing requirements.



Virtual Destructor:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
    base() { cout << "Base class Constructor\n"; }
	~base() { cout << "Base class Destructor\n"; }
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	derived() { cout << "Derived class Constructor\n"; }
    ~derived() { cout << "Derived class Destructor\n"; }
};

int main()
{
	base* bptr = new derived();
	delete bptr;
	return 0;
}
// o/p
// Base class Constructor
// Derived class Constructor
// Base class Destructor


// FIX
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
    base() { cout << "Base class Constructor\n"; }
	virtual ~base() { cout << "Base class Destructor\n"; }
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	derived() { cout << "Derived class Constructor\n"; }
    ~derived() { cout << "Derived class Destructor\n"; }
};

int main()
{
	base* bptr = new derived();
	delete bptr;
	return 0;
}
// o/p
// Base class Constructor
// Derived class Constructor
// Derived class Destructor
// Base class Destructor
